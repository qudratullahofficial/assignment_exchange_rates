Task1:
	Prepare a web widget using the JavaScript framework of your choice, showing current exchange rates of a few well-known currencies e.g. USD, EUR, CHF, AUD, CAD to GBP.
	
Response:
	Widget is prepared using javascript and jquery showing exchange rate of all currencies getting from API. You can get also get few currencies data if you specify "symbols"
	parameter separated by comma with countries currencies in API url like USD,EUR,CHF,AUD,CAD. "symbols" parameter is used in API just for example.

Task2:
	The widget should communicate with a local backend, written with either PHP or Nodejs and using the framework of your choice if applicable.
	
Response:
	Widget is communicating with backend (php) using MVC framework codeigniter. Solution is very flexible and scalable. Object Oriented techniques are used.
	MVC pattern followed. Used proper layout system which gives power to manage multiple layouts throughout the project. 
	Also used things like Hooks,Yield,Inheritance,OOP techniques and software design patterns.

Task3: 
	The backend should hold API access keys, etc. should call some free API e.g. https://exchangeratesapi.io/documentation/ or any other in case of problems getting free account working.
	
Response:
	API access keys are used which are stored in web.config file for cleaner solution. Project is able to run on any apache server without zero configuration.
	Solution is capable to determine appropriate server urls automatically.

Task4:
	Example of possible output – just as a general guide – no flags required.
	
Response:
	Flags are not included. We can use flags but we need to download images from internet or from some onine api if available.

Task5:
	Include a refresh button and/or auto update
	
Response:
	Refresh button included. Also used a text box in which you can ask for any currency and conversion rates.

Task 6:
	The system could implement some caching mechanism to avoid redundant calls for a couple of minutes.
	
Response:
	Caching technique is used to avoid multiple calls on server. If user requested one currency data and calls again the solution will return cached data.

Task 7:
	The app deployment information could include steps to deploy via a docker container
	
Response:
	You need to paste this solution in htdocs folder of xampp with name "exchange_rates" folder and project will run fine. I also uploaded this project online so you can view.

	This domain was availble to me so I uploaded on this.

Please have a look and let me know in case of any question.

Thanks.
